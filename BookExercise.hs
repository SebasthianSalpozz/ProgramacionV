--What are the types of the following functions?
second xs = head (tail xs)
--Type: second :: [a] -> a

swap (x, y) = (y, x)
--Type: swap :: (b, a) -> (a, b)

pair x y = (x, y)
--Type: pair :: a -> b -> (a, b)

double x = x * 2
--Type: double :: Num a => a -> a
--(Uses the Num type class for multiplication)

palindrome xs = reverse xs == xs
--Type: palindrome :: Eq a => [a] -> Bool
--(Uses the Eq type class for equality comparison)

twice a x = a (a x)
-- Type: twice :: (t -> t) -> t -> t

--Why is it not feasible in general for function types to be instances of the Eq class? When is it
--feasible? Hint: two functions of the same type are equal if they always return equal results for
--equal arguments
--No es factible que los tipos de funciones sean instancias de la clase 'Eq' porque determinar la igualdad de funciones puede resultar complicado. 
--Las funciones pueden tener efectos secundarios o depender de estados externos,lo que dificulta compararlas Ãºnicamente por sus resultados. 
--La viabilidad surge cuando las funciones siempre devuelven los mismos resultados para los mismos argumentos y no dependen de estados externos.

--Exercise Chapter 4
--Without using any other library functions or operators, show how the meaning of the following
--pattern matching definition for logical conjunction && can be formalised using conditional
--expressions:
-- True && True = True
-- _ && _ = False
--Answer:
myAnd :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
myAnd x y = if x == True then
            if y == True then True
            else False
            else False
--Do the same for the following alternative definition, and note the difference in the number of
--conditional expressions that are required:
-- True && b = b
-- False && _ = False
myAnd2 :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
myAnd2 x y = if x == True then y
            else False

--Show how the meaning of the following curried function definition can be formalised in terms of
--lambda expressions:
--mult :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
--mult x y z = x * y * z
--Answer:
mult :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
mult = \x -> (\y -> (\z -> x * y * z))

--The Luhn algorithm is used to check bank card numbers for simple errors such as mistyping a
--digit, and proceeds as follows:
-- consider each digit as a separate number;
-- moving left, double every other number from the second last;
-- subtract 9 from each number that is now greater than 9;
-- add all the resulting numbers together;
-- if the total is divisible by 10, the card number is valid.
--Define a function luhnDouble :: Int -> Int that doubles a digit and subtracts 9 if the result is
--greater than 9.
luhnDouble :: Int -> Int
luhnDouble x | x * 2 > 9 = x * 2 - 9
             | otherwise = x * 2

--Using luhnDouble and the integer remainder function mod, define a function 
--luhn :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int -> Bool that decides if a four-digit bank card number is valid.
luhn :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int -> Bool

               else False

--Exercise Chapter 5
--A positive integer is perfect if it equals the sum of all of its factors, excluding the number itself.

--Show how the list comprehension [(x,y) | x <- [1,2], y <- [3,4]] with two generators
